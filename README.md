# Bye-Ping

Say goodbye to the ping of your games with a simple file!
Bye ping is only available in Spanish language


This simple file can reduce your ping by 60% percent! It is not that this program is wonderful and everyone goes to 80 ping in their games but there may be a small change for example if before you had 200 ping now you can have 150 ping I would appreciate it if you help me to popularize this program :)

ATTENTION!
Before running this program, if something goes wrong remember to make a restore point on your pc.

**Note**

*Some antiviruses detect that this is a virus but the program is not a virus!*

*The most common reason that some antiviruses detect that this is a virus is because the program generates some files to achieve the configurations and reduce the ping,* *another reason may be because cmd is executed, this is essential for its operation since this program is programmed in batch you can check all the code right here on github!*
 
*you can use popular antivirus like avast to verify that this is not a virus*

A= I still don't know clearly but to remove the black screen you have to restart the computer, don't worry! when you finish running bye-ping your pc will automatically restart
