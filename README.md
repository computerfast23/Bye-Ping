# Bye-Ping

Say goodbye to the ping of your games with a simple file!
Bye ping is only available in Spanish language


This simple file can reduce your ping by 60% percent! It is not that this program is wonderful and everyone goes to 80 ping in their games but there may be a small change for example if before you had 200 ping now you can have 150 ping I would appreciate it if you help me to popularize this program :)

*The most common reason that some antiviruses detect that this is a virus is because the program generates some files to achieve the configurations and reduce the ping, *another reason may be because cmd is executed, this is essential for its operation since this program is programmed in batch you can check all the code right here on *github!
